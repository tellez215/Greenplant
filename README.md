# GreenPlantLovers

## Description
Created my first landing page with the information I learned with HTML and CSS. 
The name of the project is called GreenPlant which gives me a color scheme already which is green.
I used 3 different colors to make the page look more appealing and a picture with a description beneath it.
First landing page with the page being visually appealing and accesible with both a navigation and inputs for contact information

## Installation
