# GreenPlantLovers

## Description
Created my first landing page with the information I learned with HTML and CSS. 
The name of the project is called GreenPlant which gives me a color scheme already which is green.
I used 3 different colors to make the page look more appealing and a picture with a description beneath it.
First landing page with the page being visually appealing and accesible with both a navigation and inputs for contact information.
It was a difficult challenge but as I start learning more and more, I start to understand more and have a much better understanding with HTML and CSS. In terms of the GitBash, I feel pretty confident navigating and pushing ,pulling. Still had a little difficulty with centering the image and making the navigation bar more visiually appealing and not having it stacked but aligned. These are things I will get better at as more projects come my way and the hours of studying. Overall it was a fun project and learned a lot while mkaing it!

## Installation
1. Created a repository and copied the SSH key thru [GitHub](https://github.com/tellez215/Greenplant)
2. Cloned the SSH key into GitBash onto my desktop
3. Within GitBash, 'git add .' will add the new information into our system
4. With a 'git status' it allows us to confirm that our information is there
5. Then with 'git commit -m' it lets us add a message with details of our recent changes or new additions
6. Lastly with a 'git push origin main' it will allow us to push our updates and messages to our origin which in this case will be 'GitHub'
